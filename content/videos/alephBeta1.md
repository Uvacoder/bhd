title: "Parshat Bereishit: Is The Torah One Big Story?"
creator: "Aleph Beta"
synopsis: "In this week’s video, we explore the unexpected link that ties all the stories in Parshat Bereishit (Genesis 1:1-6:8) together. Have you ever considered why God chose to tell us these specific stories from the first thousand years of world history? Maybe Parshat Bereishit may actually serve as a crucial prologue to the rest of the Torah’s story. Until we truly understand the hidden meaning in that prologue, we can't begin to understand the depth of the Torah in its entirety."

Now all of this should be the review of this book, as concerns Burning Heart Discipleship and it being a resource towards
that end.  This should probably be set to a field called "description" automatically via Nuxt Content module.
